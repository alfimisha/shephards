# Rehabilitation automation model
This is a model that recognizes user movement based on sensor data, records this movement, and provides instant feedback if the subsequent movement patterns are similar to the initial movement. Its intended use is for rehabilitating patients, to autonomously perform rehabilitation exercises without direct supervision once assigned.
